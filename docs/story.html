<hr /> 
<p>My dad, <b><span style="color:Maroon;font-size: 30px">LIN SUNG PEN 林松本</span></b>  is a <b> CERAMIST</b>.</p>
<p>I used to call him, <b><span style="color:DarkGoldenRod">THE GREATEST CERAMIST</span></b>.(LOL)</p>
<p>He can make any kinds of potterys such as bowls, plates, vases, and especially teapots</b>.</p>
<p>His teapots are very different from the ordinary ones which we used to see in our daily life.</p>
<p>Some might regard them as arts, instead of teapots.</p>
<p>Because they actually don't look like teapots but other things.</p>
<p>For example, pumpkins, bamboo, wood, or even turtles.</p>
<p>He's good at mimicing various creatures and plants throughout the nature.</p>
<p>The creations look so real that most of the people can't believe they were actually made of clay.</p>
<p>And that's how special and wonderful his teapots are !</p>
<p>What's more,</p>
<p>The teapots aren't made by <cite>potter's wheel or models</cite></p>
<p>Instead,</p>
<p>He made them by <b><span style="color: red">his own hands!!!</span></b></p>
<p>You probably think that it's not something really cool.</p>
<p>However</p>
<p>It's never easy to shape the body into a very round ball without machine or models!</p>
<p>If you still don't believe it...</p>
<p>WELCOME TO OUR STUDIO AND TRY IT YOURSELF!</p>
<p>And I'm sure that you will realize the difficulty right away!(EVIL SMILE)</p>
